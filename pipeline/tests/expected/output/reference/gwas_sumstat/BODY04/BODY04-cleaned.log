After removal of variants that are not SNPs or are ambiguous, 885 variants remain.
Using SNP, A1 and A2 to merge with the reference.
After matching variants to the reference, 885 variants remain.
1 variants were flipped to match reference.
INFO column is not present.
FREQ  column is not present.
After removal of SNPs with reference MAF < 0.01, 871 variants remain.
Reported MAF column is not present, so discordance with reference cannot be determined.
After removal of SNPs with out-of-bound P values, 871 variants remain.
After removal of SNPs with duplicate IDs, 871 variants remain.
After removal of SNPs with N > 334358.59618899 or < 126741.40381101, 841 variants remain.
Genomic control was not detected.
After removal of SNPs with SE == 0, 841 variants remain.
