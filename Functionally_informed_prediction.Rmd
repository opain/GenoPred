# Introduction

Polygenic scores are a useful research tool and a promising oppurtunity for personalised medicine. A polygenic score is calculated for each individual as the effect size-weighted sum of alleles that an individual carries. The effect size of each variant is most often estimated using a genome-wide association study (GWAS), which uses regression to estimate the association of each variant to a given phenotype. The predictive utility of polygenic scores can be increased by incorporating prior distributions on causal effect sizes, thereby reducing the signal to noise ratio. The estimated polygenicity and heritability of a given phenotype is a common approach for improving the predictive utility of polygenic scores. However, prior distributions can also be derived by considering whether a variant is within a functional group associated with the phenotype. A recent method called LDPred-funct adapts the bayesian shrinkage method of LDPred to incoporate the prior likelihood of causality based on functional enrichment scores. Further research is required to evaluate alternative strategies that integrate the functional effect of genetic variation when calculating polygenic scores.

A mechanism explaining a large proportion of common genetic associations is the regulation of gene expression. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies have idenitifed many genetic variants associated with differential gene expression. Integration of eQTL and GWAS associations enables inference of gene expression changes associated with the GWAS phenotype, an approach called transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS). TWAS aggregates the effect of genetic associations in a functionally-informed manner to higlight associated up-/down-regulated genes within a specific tissue, cell type and developmental stage. TWAS is able to idenitfy novel associations by considering a variants effect within specific spatio-temporal context. This approach has been useful for idenitfying plausible candidate genes for follow-up within an experitmental context.

There has been limited research investigting the predictive utility of polygenic scores that consider the effect of each variant on gene expression. Stratifying gentic variation based on whether variants are eQTLs when calcualting polygenic scores has shown eQTL polygenic scores explain a disproptionaite amount of variance compared to non-eQTL variants. Furthermore, a combination of functionally agnostic polygenic scores and eQTL only polygenic scores has been shown to improve prediction. Most previous studies have used binary definitions indicating whether a variant is an eQTL, often not considering the spatio-temporal context of the eQTL association. One study used a more sophisticated approach, here referred to as gene-expression risk scores (GeRS), which considers the joint effect of variation on each gene expression expression within specific spatio-temporal context. GeRS are calculated as the sum of TWAS-based effect sizes weighted by the predicted expression for an individual. GeRSs were shown to significantly predict schizophrenia, with gene expression risk scores derived using prefrontal cortex eQTL data explaining the most variance but a model containing GeRS based on multiple tissues improving prediction. The variance explained by GeRS was less than polygenic scores based on the same GWAS summary statistics because they only capture associations mediated through cis-eQTL associations. However, whether GeRS can improve prediction in combination with polygenic scores was not investigated.

This study evaluates the predictive utility of GeRS calculated using several strategies. The predictive utility of models containing polygenic scores and GeRS is also investigated. Comparison to alternative functionally-agnostic and functionally-informed polygenic scoring methods is performed.

# Methods

## Samples
- UK Biobank
- TEDS

## Outcomes

* UK Biobank
  * Depression (binary)
  * Intelligence (continuous)
  * Body mass index (BMI - continuous)
  * Height (continuous)
  * Coronary Artery Disease (CAD - Binary)
  * Type II Diabetes (T2D - Binary)
  * Inflammatory Bowel Disorder (IBD - Binary)
  * Rheumatoid arthritis (RheuArth - Binary)

* TEDS
  * ADHD traits (continuous)
  * Height (continuous)
  * Body mass index (BMI - continuous)
  * GCSE scores (continuous)

Note. Multiple Slerosis in UK Biobank was not included due to insufficent SNP data in the corresponding GWAS for TWAS.

## Genotypic data
Both target sample underwent stringent quality control prior to imputation using the HRC-reference. After imputation, genotypes were converted to PLINK hard-calls, and only HapMap3 SNPs were retained. Eureopean individuals within the target samples were identified and retained if they were within the 3SD of the 1KG European mean of the first 100 principal components.

## GWAS summary statistics
For each target phenotype, the largest independent phenotype-matched GWAS was selected for calculating polygenic scores. More information can be found in the table below.

## Gene expression risk scores (GeRS)

TWAS integrates GWAS summary statistics with multi-SNP predictors of gene expression (SNP-weights) to infer gene expression associations. Multi-SNP predictors in combination with individual-level genotype data can also be used to predict the expression level of genes within an each individual. GeRS are calculated as the TWAS-effect size weighted sum of predicted gene expression levels in each individual.

This study used SNP-weights derived from multiple panels capturing eQTL effects across a range of adult tissues. SNP-weights were downloaded from the FUSION website. TWAS was performed using FUSION and SNP-weights were used to calculated predicted expression levels using PLINK. GeRS for each panel were then calculated in R. To account for the correlation between the predicted expression of nearby features due to LD, feature clumping was used to remove features within 5Mb of lead features with a predicted expression r^2 of >0.9. Due to the complex LD structure within the MHC region, only the lead feature within this region was retained.

TWAS, gene expression prediction and GeRS calculations were carried out using LD and MAF estimations from an ancestry matched reference genotype dataset. The same SNP-weights are used to predict expression levels regardless of the target samples, using MAF imputation to account for missing variation. Predicted expression levels for each gene are then standardised based on the ancestry-matched mean and standard deviation of expression. Clumping of features is performed using predicted expression level in the reference sample.

The code used to prepare the reference data required for calculating GeRS can be found [here](https://opain.github.io/GenoPred/Pipeline_prep.html#5_functionally-informed_polygenic_scoring).
The code used for calculating predicted expression levels in the target samples can be found [here](https://opain.github.io/GenoPred/Genotype-based_scoring_in_target_samples.html#4_functionally-informed_polygenic_scoring)

## Functionally-agnostic polygenic scoring
Polygenic scores were derived using the following methods: 

  1. p-value thresholding and clumping (pT + clump).
  2. lassosum - Lasso-based shrinkage method.
  3. PRScs - Bayesian shrinkage method.
  4. SBLUP - Summary statistic-based BLUP estimates
  5. SBayesR - Bayesian joint estimation method
  6. LDPred - Bayesian joint estimation method

Polygenic scores were derived using a reference standardised pipeline. Two references were used for all methods, the European subset of the 1KG reference ([described here](https://opain.github.io/GenoPred/Pipeline_prep.html#4_polygenic_scoring)), and an independant subset of 10K European individuals from UK Biobank ([described here](https://opain.github.io/GenoPred/Pipeline_prep_withUKBB_ref.html#3_polygenic_scoring)). In brief, all scores were derived using HapMap3 SNPs only, modelling LD based on these references Any HapMap3 missing in the target sample are imputed using the reference estimated allele frequency.

Polygenic scoring in target samples has been previously documented [here](https://opain.github.io/GenoPred/Determine_optimal_polygenic_scoring_approach.html)

<br/>

## Estimating predictive ability
Models containing a single predictor were derived using generalised linear model (GLM). Models containing multiple predictors were derived using elastic-net regularisation to reduce the likelihood of overfitting and account for multicollinearity when modelling highly correlated predictors. 10-fold cross validation was performed using 80% of individuals to identify optimal parameters, with subsequent test-set validation in the remaining 20% of individuals to estimate the predictive utility among individuals not included in the parameter selection process.

Model building and evaluation was performed using an Rscript called Model_builder.R (more information [here](https://github.com/opain/GenoPred/tree/master/Scripts/Model_builder)).

# Conclusion

* Gene expression risk scores (GeRS) can explain a significantly non-zero amount of variance in a range of phenotypes
* The amount of variance explained by GeRS is less than explained by a genome-wide or TWAS SNP-weight stratified polygenic scores, except for Rheumatoid Arthritis.
* Use of elastic net models to combine GeRSs derived using multiple pTs does not significantly improve prediction over the single best pT as idenitified using 10-fold cross validation, though prediction never decreases
* Inclusion of GeRS based on SNP-weights derived using multiple tissues consistently improves prediction over the single best tissues as idenitified using 10-fold cross validation
* Inclusion of GeRSs only improved prediction over genome-wide polygenic scores for rheumatoid arthritis, providing an 1.6 times increase in r2 (0.021 to 0.035). Prediction improvements were non significant for all other henotypes in UK Biobank and TEDS.
* However, PRScs polygenic scores which does not use LD clumping  reduces the benefit of using GeRS for all outcomes, and the increase for RheumArth is no longer significant. This indicates the gain is in the fact that GeRS are based on joint SNP models.
* This findings suggest that GeRS represent a component of risk captured within genome-wide polygenic scores, rather than containing novel information.
* This indicates GeRS may be more useful for stratifying risk rather than improving risk prediction in a linear model.
* TWAS SNP PRS explain a suprisingly large amount of variance considering they only contain a fraction of the genome.


In the Crohn's disease paper they use Ileal specific eQTLs by coparing to whole blood. They also used colocalisation and SMR to idenitfy genes with shared causal variant with IBD. It also only used candidate IBD genes as tagged by the immunochip. Ileal QTL data was derived using the target sample so possible overfitting. They mention the question of coherence and incoherence, indicating whether SNPs affect gene expression as well the phenotype?

* I should try filtering genes based on coloc PP4 values
* I should try using tissue-specific eQTL effects

Compare gain in R2 when including multiple tissue but use the same genes, so gains represent gian from tissue specificity rather than number of genes. Though SNP-weight sets with large sample will stll predict better due to higher R2 estimates.

I think I could end the study here and keep it short and sweet. Although it is tempting to include a GeRS based on PrediXcan/MetaXcan models. This would be a quite a substantial rework though as it would require more than HapMap3 variants:
- Subset UK Biobank individuals with required phenotype data
- Predict expression using PrediXcan and GTEx v7 models
- Perform TWAS using GTExv7 models for desired GWAS
- Create feature correlation matrix using 1000 genomes
- Calculate GeRS
- For comparison also calculate PRS based on more than HapMap3 SNPs (interesting comparison anyway)

Making this change moves away from the highly reference standardised framework as the availability of SNPs will vary across target samples. I need to figure out what SNP list these models are based on.

SCZ TWAS: "A GE-PRS from actual measured expression and differential splicing in brain was significant but substantially less so than the genetic GE-PRS (Supplementary Fig. 13). Based on polygenic theory37,38, the best TWAS GE-PRS was estimated to account for 26% of the total SCZ SNP-heritability, providing an upper-bound on the amount of trait variance that could be mediated by the steady-state expression in these tissues (Supplementary Note)."
