### GenoPred Tools

The GenoPred tools provide robust and easy-to-use software for the calculation and interpretation of polygenic scores.

The tools can be used to efficiently calculate polygenic scores using a range of leading polygenic scoring methods, based on results from many genome-wide association studies, for just one individual or large-scale cohorts. 

A reference-standardised approach is used throughout, meaning the polygenic scores are clinically interpretable and comparable across samples, providing advantages for both research and clinical purposes.

The user simply specifies what they want the platform to do using a configuration file, and then runs a one-line snakemake command, to execute all the required analyses within a controlled software environment.
